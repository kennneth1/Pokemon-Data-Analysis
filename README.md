# Pokemon-Data-Analysis
Battle statistic analysis

This program reads the Pokemon.csv file and cleans the entry names/explores data/visualize data

attack_plotter() aggregates Pokemon data by "Type", calculates the mean of that "Type", then generates a bar plot.
hp_vs_attack() and speed_vs_attack() compares important pokemon stats to visualize trends and notable correlations

hp_vs_attack shows weak correlation, whereas speed_vs_attack has a stronger upwards correlation
