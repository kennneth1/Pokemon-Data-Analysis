# Pokemon-Data-Analysis

This program reads the Pokemon.csv file and cleans the entry names, and explores/visualizes data

attack_plotter() aggregates Pokemon data by "Type", calculates the mean of that group, then generates a bar plot.

*(Dragon type pokemon tend to have base attack stats)

hp_vs_attack() and speed_vs_attack() compares important pokemon stats to visualize trends and notable correlations

hp_vs_attack shows weak correlation, whereas speed_vs_attack has a strong upwards correlation
